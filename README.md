# Eugenie

Companies are now asking - how do you stand out in a market that is oversaturated with similar brands? Apart from the obvious answer - having the better product, some genius marking tactics are needed. That is where Eugenie comes in. Through the ever growing 'word-of-mouth' style marketing, Eugenie connects Brands and Creators in order to deliver first hand recommendations that feel to be coming from a trusted friend. 

Empowering Creators and Enchanting Brands, that is the Eugenie way.
